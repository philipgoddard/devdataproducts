## A common problem

* It is a well known fact that data scientists often encounter three types of iris, and they get fired if they cannot tell which is which.

* To obviate this quandary, they often like to perform machine learning in case they have to make predictions based on sepal and petal measurements.

## What are the typical measurements? 

* We can investigate pairwise relationships to gain some intuition as to how the iris species differ.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
names(iris) = gsub("\\.", "", names(iris))
n1 <- nPlot(SepalLength ~ PetalWidth, group = 'Species', data = iris, type = 'scatterChart')

#r1 <- rPlot(SepalLength ~ PetalWidth,
#            data = iris,
#            color = 'Species',
#            type = 'point'
#            )
#r1$save('fig/r1.html')
n1$save('fig/n1.html')

```

## Machine learning with LDA

* A linear discriminant analysis algorithm can be easily fitted using the algorithm in the MASS library. Note that trying to fit this using the caret package is too cpu intensive for a free account!


```{r, message= FALSE}
library(MASS)
ldaTune <- lda(Species ~ ., data = iris)
```

* Predictions can be made for new samples by inserting the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width.

```{r}
predict(ldaTune, newdata = data.frame(PetalLength = 3.4,
                                      PetalWidth = 2.1,
                                      SepalLength = 5.3,
                                      SepalWidth = 1.1))$class
```

## Integrating it into a Shiny App

* For ease of making predictions, our model has been integrated into a Shiny App.

* The user may explore the pairwise predictor relationships before inserting their measurements to obtain a prediction of the iris type based on the measurments.

* Please feel free to try it out, and use it should you have to predict iris species in a hurry!
